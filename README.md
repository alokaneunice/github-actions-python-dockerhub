# github-actions-python-dockerhub
A python flask application to be pushed to dockerhub. In this project, we will see how to build a docker image & push it to the dockerhub using GitHub actions workflow.

To push the docker image to docker hub we first need to log into dockerhub so, for that we need to store the docker hubâ€™s credentials in the secrets.

In your repository, store the credentials in the secrets under repository settings.
